# Excelling with Excell

Background 
The Edinburgh Fringe is one of the most popular world festival of arts and culture event that takes place yearly. The event features more than 50,000 performances with more than 3,000 shows of various types held across many venues. (wiki)
Among program categories and subcategories featured are theatre, music comedy, dance, food, film & video documentary, photography, tabletop games, space exploration and plays. Participants, contributors and promotion groups are from many different countries like USA, Canada, Australia, Great Britain, Europe and others.
Focus of This Project
Louise was impressed by some of the shows featured at this Fringe and expressed interest in more details on how some plays got started and whether or not they were funded by Kickstarter. The shows of interest to Louise are: (a) Be Prepared (b) Checkpoint 22 (c) Cutting Off Kate Bush (d) Jestia and Raedon (e) The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Family
The dataset provided in this project is titled Kickstarter. It is compiled with special attention to the originator, show description or blurb, goal, pledged, outcomes, country, currency, deadline, launched date, staff_pick, backers_count, spotlight, outcomes, category and subcategory. Our expectation is that these areas of investigation will reveal convincing information which will assist Louise’s decision making.
In particular, we need to determine how many Kickstarter campaigns came close to their goals and if or not the length of campaign contributes to the success or failure.
Approach
The analysis looks at the outcomes of the fundraising with emphasis on “successful”, “failed” and “canceled” in reference to set “Goal” and “Pledged”. The percentage rate in each one of these should tell the story.
Conclusion / Visualization of the observation
The Pivot Table and Line Chart 1 describes the outcome in the above-mentioned outcome classes as it relates to the dollar amount realized.


The Pivot Table and Line Chart 2 shows the outcome in those same areas based on Launch Date.


Recommendation and suggestion

Although the Pivot Table and Line Charts gives a representation of the outcome, we should further apply additional  statistical methods to better understand the spread of the distribution. That way, we can determine the central tendency and see if it is skewed to the right or to the left.
Risk
1.There is a level of uncertainty as to how clean and reliable the given data is. Some parts of the data may not be accurate. However, the data can always be cleaned and modified as necessary to reflect distribution tendencies.
2.Our domain knowledge of the industry operations is limited due to short time to deliver. With more time, we can do better research to support our findings
